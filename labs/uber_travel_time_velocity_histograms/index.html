            <p>It will be beneficial for you to leave your previous lab work untouched by copying them to a new folder for this lab and modify only the files in the new folder</p>
            <p>If you were not able to complete Uber Velocity and Fastest List from the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/uber_velocity_fastest_list/">Lab 11</a>, you can create a brand new program. The feature set between both lab assignments are independent, however, if you could not calculate velocity then calculate a histogram of starting x-positions (3rd column). Just follow the download instructions from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/display_highscore_uber_ridecount_distance/">Lab 10</a> and coordinate with your lab instructor.</p>
            <p>Update your Uber Velocity and Fastest List program from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/uber_velocity_fastest_list/">Lab 11</a> to add the following features (or write a new program that does the following):</p>
