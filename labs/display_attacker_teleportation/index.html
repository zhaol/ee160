            <p>Update the display program that you completed from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/display_boundaries_items/">Lab 09</a></p>
            <p>It will be beneficial for you to leave your previous lab work untouched by copying them to a new folder for this lab and modify only the files in the new folder</p>
            <p>If you were not able to complete Display with Boundaries and Items from the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/display_boundaries_items/">Lab 09</a>, you can modify a fresh copy of the display program. The feature set between both lab assignments are independent. Just follow the download instructions from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/display_boundaries_items/">Lab 09</a> and coordinate with your lab instructor.</p>
            <p>Update your Display with Boundaries and Items program from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/display_boundaries_items/">Lab 09</a> to add the following features:</p>

                  <li>you will most likely need to track another set of x and y positions</li>

                  <li>you will most likely need to have a function that compares two locations and returns how to get closer from one location to the other</li>
                  <li>you will need to update the <code>redraw_screen()</code> function in <a href="https://github.com/zhaol/game_scaffold/blob/v1.1.1/display_helpers.c"><em class="file well well-small">display_helpers.c</em></a> to display the attacker</li>
