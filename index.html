        <p>Announcements:</p>
        <ul><li>Class announcments will be made on <a href="http://piazza.com">Piazza</a></li></ul>
        <p>Development Environment:</p>
        <p>The place where you write your programs, like Microsoft Word is the environment/program where you write documents</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any computer that can compile C</li>
          <li>Recommend using <a href="http://c9.io">Cloud9 IDE</a> to make it easier:
            <ul>
              <li>for instructors to help troubleshoot your issues and answer your questions</li>
              <li>for you to start working by reducing the amount of "setup" work (like installing libraries and programs) you need to do </li>
              <li>for everyone to share knowledge by reducing the amount of environment discrepancies</li>
              <li>for you to work on your code from any machine (as well as giving you all the other benefits of the cloud)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lecture Notes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hosted by <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> at <a href="http://zhaol.github.io/ee160">http://zhaol.github.io/ee160</a></li>
          <li>Please feel free to correct any mistakes/typos by emailing me or submitting a pull request (extra kudos for a <abbr title="pull request" data-toggle="tooltip">PR</abbr>)</li>
          <li>During lecture, instructor will be using a Cloud9 workspace located at <a href="https://ide.c9.io/zhaol/ee160">https://ide.c9.io/zhaol/ee160</a></li>
          <li>Students are free to review at a later time or ask questions or make comments through the workspace during lecture in real time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fellow Students:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collaboration is encouraged (except on midterms and finals)</li>
          <li>
            <blockquote>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."</blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>Teaching a fellow student will enforce your own understanding</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A fellow student who has just learned a concept will be aware of the "assumptions" and "gotchas" involved</li>
          <li>Peer-to-peer is a powerful way to learn and share knowledge, just like how social media can powerfully share information and data</li>
          <li>Collaborating does not mean cheating; do collaborate; don't cheat</li>
          <li>Make sure you understand the material and concepts when collaborating; don't just get the answer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fellow Humans:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Search online with <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> or any other search engine</li>
          <li>Post a question on question and answer forums, like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" data-toggle="tooltip" title="StackOverflow (SO) is a free Q&A forum for programming enthusiasts">StackOverflow</a> (it's one of the better programming Q&A sites)</li>
          <li><a href='http://www.theallium.com/engineering/computer-programming-to-be-officially-renamed-googling-stackoverflow/'>this satirical article</a> makes fun of how often programming professionals need to leverage off of the knowledge of others</li>
          <li>
            being able to read and learn from others as well as understanding your peers is a soft skill that is necessary in any profession
            <ul>
              <li>eventually, you should be able to write and teach others as well as express your thoughts and ideas to your peers</li>
            </ul>
