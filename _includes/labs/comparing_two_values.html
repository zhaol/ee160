<ul>
  <li>Create a program that will accept 2 numbers and then print the difference between the two numbers as well as a message depending on which number is greater
    <h5>Here are some addition requirements:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><em>[difference]</em> = the difference between the 2 values</li>
      <li>if the first value is greater, then print out <pre>The first value is greater than the second value by <em>[difference]</em></pre>
        <ul>
          <li>example: <pre>The first value is greater than the second value by 2.3."</pre></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>if the second value is greater, then print out <pre>The second value is greater than the first value by <em>[difference]</em></pre>
        <ul>
          <li>example: <pre>The seconde value is greater than the first value by 2.3</pre></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The difference should never be displayed as a negative number
        <ul>
          <li>this should not happen: <pre>The first value is greater than the first value by -2.3</pre></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>if the first and second value are equal, then print out <pre>Both values are equal.</pre></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
