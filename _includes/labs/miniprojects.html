<p>For the remainder of the labs in this semester, you will be working on mini-project(s). You are free to choose the mini-project that most interests. You can use any library or functions you can find online. The focus of these mini-projets is on developing algorithms to solve a problem, and not on solving the C language shortcomings. If you do use any library or functions that we have not discussed in class, please let me know what you are using. I will determine if those can be allowed in the final exam or not. On the final exam, you will be asked to write a program that is similar in complexity to the mini-projects. For the final exam, assume you will only be allowed to use functions that we have discussed in class.</p>

  <p class="topic">Mini-Project Grading Policy:</p>
  <div class="details">
    <p>Your grade for the remainder of the labs will be based on the score for your mini-project(s). You are only required to do one mini-project. However, you can do more than one to better your chances of getting a higher grade (and also get more practice for the final exam). Or more importantly get more experience in solving problems with programming. Or better yet, because you love programming. :-)</p>
    <p>The highest score out of your mini-projects will be used.</p>

  <p class="topic">Mini-Project Grading Workflow:</p>
  <div class="details">
    <p>I want to give the students the most opportunity to work on what they enjoy and at their own pace, however, I do not want the lab instructors to be overworked with grading. So hopefully, the below process will be a happy medium:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>After the student finishes the first mini-project, s/he coordinates with the lab instructor to submit the first mini-project for grading</li>
      <li>The student can then decide to work on the second mini-project or wait for the grading results from the lab instructor. It is the student's responsibility to coordinate with the lab instructor when the score will be returned so the student will have time to work on another mini-project or resubmit the first mini-project.</li>
      <li>If the student chooses to do a second mini-project:<br/> when the student finishes the second mini-project, s/he must coordinate with the lab instructor to submit the second project for grading. The student can then decide to work on the third mini-project or wait for the grading results from the lab instructor. It is the student's responsibility to coordinate with the lab instructor when the score will be returned so the student will have time to work on another mini-project or resubmit the second mini-project.</li>
      <li>If the student chooses to wait for the grade from the first mini-project:<br/> when s/he receives the grade for the first mini-project, s/he can accept the grade and be done. Or the student can fix his/her first mini-project and resubmit the first mini-project. Or the student can move on to the second mini-project. The student can resubmit the first mini-project at most two times (i.e. the first project will be graded at most three times). This resubmission process applies to all 3 mini-projects.</li>

  <p class="topic">Mini-Project Grading Extras:</p>
  <div class="details">
    <p>These are the situations I am trying to avoid:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students giving the lab instructors 2 or 3 projects (including resubmitted projects) to grade on the very last lab section. If this happens, the lab instructor is allowed to grade just one (whichever one s/he chooses) and give the student the grade for that project.  If the student has a higher grade from a previously graded mini-project, then the lab instructor will use the highest of the grades received by the student as the grade for the remainder of the labs</li>
      <li>Students continually submitting their projects and having the lab instructors figure things out and solve things for the student. The lab instructors are only required to provide comments for at most 2 gradings. On the 3rd and final grading, the lab instructors are not required to provide feedback and can just assign a grade</li>
      <li>If a student already has a 100% on one of the mini-projects, the lab instructor are not required to grade any more mini-projects or resubmissions for that particular student. This is to allow the lab instructor time to grade other students' mini-projects. If the lab instructor has time, then s/he can choose to provide feedback. Grading other students' mini-projects will be higher in priority. The student with a 100% grade on a previous mini-project is free to verify themselves whether or not their program fulfills the mini-project requirements</li>

  <p class="topic">Mini-Project Grading Summary:</p>
  <div class="details">
    <ul>
      <li>you are only required to complete 1 mini-project, but are encouraged to do more for yourself and to better prepare for the final exam</li>
      <li>you need to coordinate with the lab instructor on when grades are returned so you have sufficient time to resubmit or do another mini-project</li>
      <li>you can resubmit a mini-project for grading at most 2 times, i.e. each mini-project can be graded at most 3 times</li>
      <li>do not turn in all of your mini-projects and resubmissions at once on the very last lab section</li>
      <li>finishing early will better your chances of getting your mini-project graded sooner</li>
      <li>the highest score out of your mini-projects will be used as the score for the remainder of the labs</li>

  <div class="details">
    <ul>
      <li>if you have another project that you would like to pursue in place of the standard mini-projects listed, then please propose it to both the class instructor and lab instructor</li>
      <li>custom projects need to be approved by both class instructor and lab instructor beforehand; otherwise, they will not be accepted</li>
      <li>please propose your custom project at least a week before the mini-project deadline</li>
