<p>The mini-project enhancements listed on this page are optional. If you do choose to implement them, please save off the original mini-projet and keep the enhanced mini-project in a separate folder from the original mini-project. The lab instructors are not required to grade or look over the enhanced mini-projects, but they may do so if they are not grading other original mini-projects and have time.</p>
