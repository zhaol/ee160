<h4>At the end of this problem you should submit to Laulima:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>a file named <span class="file well well-small">UHusername_updated_displayer.c</span>
    <p>example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="file well well-small">zhaol_updated_displayer.c</span></li>

    <p>Update your displayer program from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/trader_displayer#displayer">Lab 07</a> so it prints out the following:
<pre>+++++++++++++
{   O   O   }
{     >     }
{  /`````\  }
+++++++++++++</pre>
    <p>If you find yourself doing a lot of copy and pasting or if making this change took a lot of mind less updates to the code (imagine if the picture was 100 lines tall), then that is an indication that your code could be improved</p>
    <p>Of course, without knowing how this image was going to be used by a program will make it hard to know how to "improve" the code to draw the image</p>
