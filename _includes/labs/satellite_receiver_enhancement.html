<p>To enhance this mini-project, you can do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>After the program has determined the "best" signal, have the program find the amount of time delay between the "best" signal and the exact signal
    <ul>
      <li>assume that all received signals can at most be received 1 second after it was sent, i.e. the maximum propagation delay is 1 second</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
