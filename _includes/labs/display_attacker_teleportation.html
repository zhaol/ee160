    <p>Update the display program that you completed from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/display_boundaries_items/">Lab 09</a></p>
    <p>It will be beneficial for you to leave your previous lab work untouched by copying them to a new folder for this lab and modify only the files in the new folder</p>
    <p>If you were not able to complete Display with Boundaries and Items from the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/display_boundaries_items/">Lab 09</a>, you can modify a fresh copy of the display program. The feature set between both lab assignments are independent. Just follow the download instructions from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/display_boundaries_items/">Lab 09</a> and coordinate with your lab instructor.</p>
    <p>Update your Display with Boundaries and Items program from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/display_boundaries_items/">Lab 09</a> to add the following features:</p>

          <li>you will most likely need to track another set of x and y positions</li>
          <li>you will most likely need to have a function that compares the x and y positions of the token and the attacker</li>
          <li>you will most likely need to have a function that compares two locations and returns how to get closer from one location to the other</li>
          <li>you will need to update the <code>redraw_screen()</code> function in <a href="https://github.com/zhaol/game_scaffold/blob/v1.1.1/display_helpers.c"><em class="file well well-small">display_helpers.c</em></a> to display the attacker</li>

        <ul class="details">
          <li>update the program so the token and attacker can warp to the other side boundary whenever they try to move outside of the boundary
            <ul>for example:
              <li>if the token/attacker is on the far right side of the screen and tries to move right, it will warp to the far left side of the screen</li>
              <li>if the token/attacker is on the far left side of the screen and tries to move left, it will warp to the far right side of the screen</li>
              <li>if the token/attacker is at the bottom of the screen and tries to move down, it will warp to the top of the screen</li>
              <li>if the token/attacker is at the top of the screen and tries to move up, it will warp to the bottom of the screen</li>

          <li>you should familiarize yourself with the mod (short for modulo) operator <code>%</code> and see how it can be applied to this problem
            <ul>
              <li>it is one of the most useful operators in programming</li>
              <li>a lot of the simple processing of information that humans do on a normal basis (without ever knowing it), when broken down for computers to replicate, will require the mod operator <code>%</code></li>
