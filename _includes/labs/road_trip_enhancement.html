<p>To enhance this mini-project, you can do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>implement the Viterbi algorithm to solve for the shortest path
    <ul>
      <li>the Viterbi algorithm, in a nutshell is:
        <p>if you know that the shortest path from San Francisco to Chicago is through Salt Lake City, then you no longer need to keep track of the other paths, like:
          <ul>
            <li>San Francisco to Las Vegas to Chicago</li>
            <li>San Francisco to Tucson to Chicago</li>
          </ul>
        </p>  
      </li>
      <li>the Viterbit Algorithm has many practical applications such as in communications; so instead of miles you are tracking the probability of a bit being correctly received</li>
